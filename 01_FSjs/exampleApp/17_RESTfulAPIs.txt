What are RESTful APIs?

APIs in general are request-response structures for two computers (a client and a server usually) to talk to each other

Code is written to request data explicitly from a server, offered through its API

REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER is a set of rules for an API to be RESTful (so that it's easier for all programmers to interface with the API)
- organizes data into various unique URLs (exampleapi.site/v2/object1, object2, object3...)
- these trailing strings after the last / are called URIs (uniform resource identifiers) and everything before the last / is the NETWORK LOCATION
- applications send HTTP REQUESTS to the API with a very specific format:
--- [START LINE] VERB /URI (example: POST /dinosaur)
------ GET: simply reading data
------ POST: creating data
------ PATCH: updating data
------ DELETE: destroying data
--- [HEADERS] metadata about the request
------ Accept: application/json (specifies the file format for the returned data)
------ Authorization: <token> (private API key to allow yourself access to the data)
------ Connection: keep-alive
--- [BODY] custom set of JSON data for a more specific request
------ { "KEY": "VALUE", ... }

The database reads the request and formats a response if it's accepted:
--- [STATUS CODE] 200 OK
------ 200s: data request was successful
------ 400s: request was incorrect
------ 500s: server isn't working
--- [HEADERS] metadata about the server/response
------ Server: nginx (what kind of server software?)
------ Age: 2323 (either the age of the uptime or the data, unsure)
------ Connection: keep-alive
--- [BODY] the payload with the desired data
------ { "id": "example123", "status": "success", ... }

This request-response format is STATELESS, meaning:
- no information needs to be stored about the computer on each end
- every API request/response is independent from the rest of your code's communication features

Pop quiz: How is a POST request different from a GET request?

it accepts a body                <---------
it parses JSON
it includes headers 
it is immutable
