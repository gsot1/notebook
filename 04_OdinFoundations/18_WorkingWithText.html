        <h1>#18: Working with Text</h1>
        <h2>How do you create a paragraph in HTML?</h2>
        <h3>There's a tag for it</h3>
        <p>Using &lt;p&gt;, you can mark text to not be condensed into a single block, allowing you to add spacing <br><br><b>like this.</b></p>
        <h2>How do you create a heading in HTML?</h2>
        <h3>With ordered numbers in mind</h3>
        <p>Using &lt;hX&gt;, you can replace X with a number from 1-6 to denote a title in a specific hierarchy <i>(that you should adhere to.)</i></p>
        <h2>How many different levels of headings are there and what is the difference between them?</h2>
        <h3>It's 5 + 1</h3>
        <p>There are six levels of headings and the bigger ones are lower numbers, intended to denote larger and larger sections <i>(meaning h1 is reserved for the biggest one.)</i></p>
        <h2>What element should you use to make text bold and important?</h2>
        <h3>a, _, c</h3>
        <p>The &lt;b&gt; tag</p>
        <h2>What element should you use to make text italicized to add emphasis to it?</h2>
        <h3>The letter that refers to you by you</h3>
        <p>The &lt;i&gt; tag</p>
        <h2>What relationship does an element have with any nested elements within it?</h2>
        <h3>Think of parenting</h3>
        <p>An element's nested elements usually share the same properties and on-screen placement, like a parent-child relationship</p>
        <h2>What relationship do two elements have if they are at the same level of nesting?</h2>
        <h3>Think of family</h3>
        <p>The elements don't usually share any properties with each other than their shared encapsulating element, like a sibling relationship</p>
        <h2>How do you create HTML comments?</h2>
        <h3>It's a little tricky</h3>
        <p>&lt;!-- but you do it like this --&gt;</p>
