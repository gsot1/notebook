# #36: Problem Solving

## Knowledge Check

### What are the three stages in the problem solving process?

Understand, Plan, Divide

### Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?

You need to make sure the problem cannot be broken down further or that you're not getting latched onto an almost-solution

### What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?

Break it down further, ask for help, start over, or take a break and come back to it later

### What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?

In programming, be sure to consider the UI, the inputs, and the steps to the outputs (as well as making sure the big problem IS MADE OF SUBPROBLEMS)

### What is an algorithm?

Algorithms are specific sets of instructions designed to convert an input to an output

### What is pseudocode?

Pseudocode is "programming" in plain english for planning coding solutions without having to worry about code syntax

### What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?

Easier-to-plan development schedules, stronger focus on individual pieces, not falling for the beginner move of trying to solve everything as one big chunk

### BONUS: Any extra special takeaways?

- Function names should double as comments
- Instructions inside functions should be readable or put in even smaller functions
- Pseudocode is as if comments explained to the computer what the code should do (instead of what the code does to others)
