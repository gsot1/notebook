// Binary Addition by garrettguy457

/*

Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

EXAMPLES: (Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))

1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)

*/

// MY VERSION

/* ...I couldn't figure it out (will do another to compensate) */

// BEST READABLE VERSION

function addBinaryBEST(a,b){
    return (a+b).toString(2) // there's a dedicated JS method for it........
  }
